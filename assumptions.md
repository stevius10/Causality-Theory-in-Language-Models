# Assumptions and Premises

## Causality as the Foundation
The theory asserts that all behavior is driven by causal relationships. Modeling these causal links is critical for replicating real-world behaviors within a simulated environment.

### Example of Causal Relationships
Consider a scenario where a person's response to a question is influenced by their prior experiences (causal factors). By modeling these experiences and their impact on behavior, the simulation can predict future responses with high accuracy.

## Language as an Expression of Causality
Language is viewed as a direct expression of thought processes rooted in causality. By modeling language, we capture the underlying causal mechanisms that drive behavior.

## Generating a Simulation through a Language Model
The iterative refinement of a language model enables the generation of a simulation that accurately reflects the full context of a given situation.

## Key Assumptions
- **Causal Determinism:** Every action or behavior is a result of preceding causes.
- **Language as a Proxy for Thought:** Language can be used to represent the causal relationships underlying behavior.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The accuracy of the simulation improves with each iteration, as more data is incorporated and refined.
