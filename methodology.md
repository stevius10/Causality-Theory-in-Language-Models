# Methodology: The Iterative Process

## Utilizing the Overarching Language Model
The language model serves as the foundation, processing inputs and generating a structured data representation that captures all relevant causal relationships.

## Iterative Refinement through Additional Input
The structured data, initially generated, is iteratively refined through subsequent interactions, adding depth and accuracy to the model.

### Addressing the Role of Simplifications
While the model may simplify certain aspects of reality to manage complexity, these simplifications are carefully considered to ensure they do not undermine the overall accuracy of the simulation.

## Ensuring Consistency and Completeness
At each iteration, the data structure is evaluated for consistency and completeness, ensuring that it captures all necessary information.

## Addressing and Refining Edge Cases
Edge cases are analyzed and refined to enhance the robustness of the model, ensuring it can handle a wide range of scenarios.

## Validation through Cross-Scenario Testing
The simulation is validated by testing it across various scenarios, confirming that it accurately represents causal relationships.
