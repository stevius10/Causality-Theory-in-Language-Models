# Introduction

## Background and Motivation
This theory is grounded in the belief that behavior is inherently causal and that language serves as a primary means of expressing these causal relationships. Understanding and accurately modeling these relationships is crucial for simulating real-world behavior.

## Theory Objective
The objective of this theory is to demonstrate that by employing an iterative process and structured data representation, it is possible to encapsulate the full context of a scenario within a simulation.

## Scope and Application
This theory is applicable across various domains, including artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and behavioral modeling, where the ability to understand and predict behavior through language is essential.

## Interdisciplinary Relevance
This theory bridges gaps between fields such as Informatics, Psychology, and Linguistics, offering insights into how causal relationships can be modeled through language, with potential applications in AI development, cognitive modeling, and more.
